## This is a work-in-progress repo for downloading lots of publicly available animated images

### The ultimate goal is to use these images for training an image2image translation GAN

- setup your conda environment with setup.sh
- use download.ipynb to gather images from miyazaki movies
- underlying code samples can be found in goku/etl
